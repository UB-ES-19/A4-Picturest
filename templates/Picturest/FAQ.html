    <p>Just like other social networks (especially Twitter), Picturest has some lingo of its own you'll want to
        understand as you navigate the site.

        can "pin" it to one of your boards.

        Meanwhile, a repin is when you take an image that's already on someone else's board and post it to one of your
        own. When you do this, notifications are sent to let the other person know you've repinned something of theirs.
